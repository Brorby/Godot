# MVP:

Tank(player) defends base against two types of enemies(infantry and tanks). Infantry can destroy base if close enough, tanks will only target player.

Tank(player) has to go out of base to get ammunition and powers-ups off dead enemies.

Enemies will get progressively harder to defend against. Encouraging player to go out of base for power-ups.  

Tank(Player) weapons:
    Machine gun is effective against infantry
    Tank turret is effective against tanks and with power-ups against infantry
